        <h1>Keyword extraction:</h1>
        This is the process of extracting keywords to summarize or categorize a text. Keyword extraction is popular in data mining because it can reveal behavior and/or popular terms related to services or products.The process can be as basic as scanning texts to create a list of the most-used words, or it can be tailored to search for and identify specific words and phrases. <br/>
        Keyword extraction can be used to find out what words people use to describe your products, or how they're talking about your latest video. By discovering words that are popular or unique to your audience, you can tailor future content to better connect with them.Keyword extraction can also be used to categorize feedback, allowing for customer service teams to quickly identify issues or complaints based on keywords.
        <br/>
        <h1>Sentiment Analysis:</h1>
        Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing opinion. This could include opinions regarding a new product line, reactions to a sporting event,<br/> or the current popularity of a politician or celebrity.Though the type of opinion can be tailored to specific needs, at a basic level, sentiment analysis extracts words or phrases from a text (tweets, for example) to determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.Sentiment analysis is helpful for social media monitoring and analyzing the popularity of your brand. It can also be helpful for customer service, as you can uncover negative feedback, categorize them by urgency, and respond to them as necessary.
        <br/>
        <h1>Market / Trend analysis:</h1>
        Market trend analysis is the process of analyzing who your audience is. This means digging into what they’re passionate about, what’s trending in their community, and where they are. This is vital for connecting with your audience, because it tells you not just how people are talking about you or your brand, but also why, where, and when. Market analysis involves tracking keywords relevant to your brand or product, following trends, and analyzing where people are talking about you. This same analysis can be applied to understanding your competition, too.<br/>The end result of this analysis is data that informs future decisions. For restaurants it can help with discovering popular menu items in particular regions.For fashion brands it can help uncover new locations for focusing sales efforts. Social media influencers also use this kind of analysis to inform decisions about who to create content for.

        TikTok's origins are different to the fairytale start-up story we have heard before. This is not an empire built by a couple of friends with a great idea in their mum's garage.<br/>
        It actually started life as three different apps.<br/><br/>
        The first was an app called Musical.ly, which launched in Shanghai in 2014 but had strong US business links and a healthy audience in that key market.<br/>
        In 2016, Chinese tech giant ByteDance launched a similar service in China called Douyin. It attracted 100 million users in China and Thailand in the space of a year.<br/>
        ByteDance decided it was onto something and wanted to expand under a different brand - TikTok. So, in 2018 it bought Musical.ly, folded it in, and began TikTok's global expansion

        title:"Tips to Limit Your Cell Phone Radiation Exposure",

         Exposure to cell phone radiation is a constant for most of us.  Our phone is with us all the time and is our connection to the world. Cell phones emit radio-frequency (RF) energy. When you hold your cell phone next to your head or wear it on your body, you can absorb over 50% of the transmitted RF energy. While cell phones bring enormous convenience to our lives, the possible health consequences of exposure to cell phone radiation have aroused considerable public attention and scientific debate.
         <br/>
         <h5>Tips to prevent from Extra radiation</h5>
         <h1>Avoid Body Contact</h1>
         Follow the phone manufacturer’s warnings found in your owner’s manual and avoid using or carrying your cell phone against your head or body at all times.  Most recommend having at least 10mm of space between you and your phone.  That means you shouldn’t keep it in your pocket and women shouldn’t keep it in their bra.
         <h1>Text More</h1>
         Whenever possible, text rather than talk. When texting your phone will be likely held in your hand and further from your body.  This distance creates a much larger buffer between you and the powerful near field radiation from the phone.
         <h1>Use Speaker Mode or a Wired Headset</h1>
         If a call must be made, use the speakerphone or a wired headset.  When holding the phone against your head for a call you are increasing the amount of radiation your head will be absorbing.  Near field radiation from the phone is most concerning when the phone is against your body.  The speaker or wired headsets reduce the amount of near field radiation you are exposed to.
         <h1>Switch Sides of Head When Talking</h1>
         Switch sides regularly during a cell phone call to reduce radiation exposure to just one side of your head.  Most of us use the same hand all the time to hold the phone when we talk.  Try to switch to your other hand and it will help so that one side of your head doesn’t always get all the radiation.<br/>
         <h1>Avoid Use When Low Signal</h1>
         Avoid using your cell phone when the signal is weak or when moving at high speed, such as in a car or train. These scenarios cause mobile phones to increase their transmitting power in an attempt to connect to the nearest cell tower. You get more radiation and your battery drains faster under these conditions.<br/>
         <h1>use Aeroplane mode</h1>
         Turn your cell phone off or put it in airplane mode when not in use. If you must leave your cell phone on at night, keep your cell phone away from your head and body while you are sleeping. Your phone continues to emit radiation even when you are not making a call.

        title:"5 Things That Happen to Your Body When You Laugh Uncontrollably",
        desc:`People always say laughter is the best medicine—but why? Sure, the hysterical and often haunting laugh spells I fall into on a daily basis feel fun, but what's actually happening to my body and brain during that time? Why does a stomach-hurting, tear-inducing laugh feel so good every time? read it....`,
        content:`
        <h1>Burn calories</h1>
        Research conducted by Maciej Buchowski, Ph.D., at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center revealed that "laughing raises energy expenditure and increases heart rate 10 to 20%." As such, 10 to 15 minutes of laughter burns approximately 10 to 40 calories per day, which equals almost four pounds a year.<br/>
        "People can't eat at McDonald's and then expect to laugh away their lunch," Buchowski says, but the numbers do provide a bit of insight into how the body manages energy and burns fat.
        <h1> RELEASE FEEL-GOOD CHEMICALS IN YOUR BRAIN.</h1>
        Laughing hysterically releases endorphins, which, in the words of Elle Woods, makes you happy. One study found even the anticipation of laughter helps "positive psychological mood states" and decreases stress. Plus, The New York Times reports that the physical act of laughing—as in the muscular movements involved in producing the sound—prompts an increase in endorphins.
        <h1> WHOLE BRAIN GETS INVOLVED</h1>
        One study experimented with the electrical activity that occurs when we laugh. "About four-tenths of a second after we hear the punch line of a joke—but before we laugh—a wave of electricity sweeps through the cortex," reports Peter Derks, a professor of psychology at the College of William and Mary.<br/>
        "What Derks finds most significant about this wave is that it carpets our entire cerebral cortex, rather than just one region," writes Peter Doskoch for Psychology Today. "So all or most of our higher brain may play a role in laughter, perhaps with the left hemisphere working on the joke's verbal content while the analytic right hemisphere attempts to figure out the incongruity that lies at the heart of much humor."
        <h1>STRENGTHENS YOUR BOND WITH OTHER PEOPLE</h1>
        This explains why joking around has become an icebreaker in many social situations. Laughing allows for a feeling of togetherness you may not otherwise find with strangers as well as a way to bond even more intimately with friends.
        <h1>RELAXES YOUR WHOLE BODY FOR UP TO 45 MINUTES.</h1>
        Laughing relieves physical tension and stress and can help your muscles relax. And if you feel physically exhausted from laughing (think pain in your abdominal muscles), it results in the same natural high exercise elicits. Recall the last time you worked out and how relaxed your body felt afterward. It's a similar feeling after a good belly laugh, and it continues for almost an hour.

        content:`
        While social media can seem like mindless and relaxing fun, it actually has a significant effect on your brain.Whenever you log on to your favorite apps, dopamine signals in your brain increase. These neurotransmitters are associated with pleasure.<br/>
        <br/>
        When you experience more dopamine after using social media, your brain identifies this activity as a rewarding one that you ought to repeat. Such a reaction may be more felt whenever you make a post of your own and gain positive feedback.The positive feelings experienced during social media use are only temporary. The way your brain engages in this positive reinforcement is also seen in other addictions.<br/><br/>
        Thus, as the feel-good dopamine wears off, you’ll go back to the source (in this case, social media) for more.In some cases, social media can be a welcome distraction if you’re isolated due to work or an illness. The more you engage, the more your brain will tell you that this is an activity that can help reduce loneliness (which may not necessarily be the case, actually).
